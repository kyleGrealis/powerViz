# PowerViz

This is a statistical power visualization tool to aide in the understanding of how power calculations are affected by multiple factors. You have the ability to choose from an array of different statistical tests, input your desired parameters, and see how power is affected.

There will be two plots created: one line chart represents how sample size affects power versus effect size, and the other bar chart displays how your chosen sample size can achieve adequate power at differing magnitudes of effect size.

Three information boxes at the bottom of the page will provide a quick summary of what would be necessary to achieve adequate power for your chosen parameters and test your parameters against what is the minimum requirement.
